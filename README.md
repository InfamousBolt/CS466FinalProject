# CS466FinalProject
We have extended the standard Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm to account for affine gap penalties. In this repository, we have provided:
- Implementation of the standard Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. at [nwAffineGapPenalties.py](https://github.com/user/repo/blob/branch/other_file.md): 
- Implementation of Needleman-Wunsch with affine gap penalties at [nwag2.py](https://github.com/InfamousBolt/CS466FinalProject/blob/main/nwag2.py): 

## How to Run the Algorithms
- You need to import the .py files. You may set a few parameters for each particular algorithm as such delta, gap open penalty, gap extension penalty, and so on. Otherwise, it would run with default values.

## Evaluation and Benchmarking
We have provided benchmarking notebook [Benchmarking_on_Balibase_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/InfamousBolt/CS466FinalProject/blob/main/Benchmarking_on_Balibase_dataset.ipynb). 
- Import the desired algorithm
- Run the notebook to benchmark the algorithm on the BAliBASE dataset. Required datasets and Python packages will be automatically downloaded when the notebook is executed.
